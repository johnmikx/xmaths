# **Visualizing Hasse Diagrams and Binary Relation Matrices**

Visualizes **Hasse diagrams** for several finite partially ordered sets (*posets*) and also explores *binary relation matrices*. Using Python libraries like `networkx`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, it features:

- A reusable function to draw **directed graphs** representing cover relations of posets.

- Multiple examples of posets, including chains and divisibility relations.

- Construction and display of binary $(0-1)$ matrices to represent relations between elements.

- Conversion of these matrices into directed graphs.

It offers a hands-on approach to understanding how ordering and connectivity can be represented visually and numerically.
