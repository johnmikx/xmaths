# **Statistical Treatments Problem Solving**

Contains solutions focusing on ***statistical treatments*** including **normality testing** with the *Shapiro-Wilk* and *Pearson-R*, **hypothesis testing** using *t-tests*, *paired t-tests* and *independent t-tests*, *linear regression modeling*, and **data visualization** with *box plots*, *scatter plots*, and *line graphs* to interpret:

1. **Correlation Between Stirring Rate and Yield**
2. **Diameter and Strength Relationships**
3. **Impedance Ratios by Position**
4. **Exam Score Distributions**

The solutions utilize the following libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy.stats`, `scipy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`.
