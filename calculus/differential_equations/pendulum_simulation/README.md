# **Pendulum Motion Simulation**

Simulates the motion of a pendulum by solving a *second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE)* using the Euler method. The simulation visualizes the angle of the pendulum over time. This approach is inspired by the concepts discussed in **3Blue1Brown's** "[Differential equations, a tourist's guide | DE1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_di4Zn4wz4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNPOjrT6KVlfJuKtYTftqH6)" video series.
