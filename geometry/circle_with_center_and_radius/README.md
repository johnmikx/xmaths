# **Visualizing a Circle with Center and Radius**

Plots a circle given its center $(h, k)$ and a point $(x, y)$ on its circumference by computing the radius using the ***distance formula***. Reinforces geometric visualization and equation of a circle concepts using `matplotlib`.

## **From the Review of Analytic Geometry (Stewart Calculus)**

An equation of a curve is an equation satisfied by the coordinates of the points on the curve and by no other points. Letâ€™s use the distance formula to find the equation of a circle with radius $r$ and center $(h, k)$. By definition, the circle is the set of all points $P(x,y)$ whose distance from the center $C(h, k)$ is $r$. Thus, $P$ is on the circle if and only if $|PC| = r$. From the ***distance formula***, we have:

$$\sqrt{(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2} = r$$

or equivalently, squaring both sides, we get:

$$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$$

This is the desired equation.

### **Equation of a Circle**
An equation of the circle with $C(h, k)$ and radius $r$ is:

$$(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$$

In particular, if the center is the origin $(0,0)$, the equation is:

$$x^2 + y^2 = r^2$$
