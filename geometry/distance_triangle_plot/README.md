# **Distance Visualization Between Two Points with Right Triangle**

Computes and displays the ***Euclidean distance between two 2D points*** by plotting a right triangle using `matplotlib`, clearly showing the horizontal and vertical legs and the hypotenuse. Ideal for reinforcing the *Pythagorean Theorem* and *spatial intuition*.

## **From the Review of Analytical Geometry (Stewart Calculus)**
To find the distance $P_1P_2$ between any two points $P_1(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2)$, we note that triangle $P_1P_2P_3$ is a right triangle, and so by the ***Pythagorean Theorem*** we have:

$$
\begin{aligned}
|P_1P_2| &=  \sqrt{|P_1P_3|^2 + |P_2P_3|^2} = \sqrt{|x_2 - x_1|^2 + |y_2 - y_1|^2} \\
         &= \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Distance Formula**
The ***distance between the points*** $P_1(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2)$ is:

$$|P_1P_2| = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$
