# **Slope Visualization**

Plots a line with labeled points and annotations to demonstrate the concept of ***slope*** as the ratio of rise to run between two points, using `matplotlib` and `numpy`.

## **From the Review of Analytical Geometry (Stewart Calculus)**
To find the equation of a line $L$ we use its $slope$, which is a measure of the steepness of the line.

### **Definition**
The **slope** of a nonvertical line that passes through the points $P_1(x_1,y_1)$ and $P_2(x_2,y_2)$

$$ m = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$

The slope of a vertical line is not defined.

Thus the slope of a line of the change in $y$, $\Delta y$ to the change in $x$, $\Delta x$. The slope is therefore the rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$. The fact that the line is straight means that the rate of change is constant.
